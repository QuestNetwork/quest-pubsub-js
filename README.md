## Description

The JavaSript implementation of the QuestNetwork PubSub Protocol.

## License 
GNU GPLv3

## Installation & Usage

``npm install @questnetwork/quest-pubsub-js``

You can `npm run test`, which will compile and run the test.js file.

We recommend to use our [quest-cli](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-cli) to test and build the package.
Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
